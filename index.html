  <div class="about">
    <p>An informal monthly meetup group for front-end web developers, to discuss new developments in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>This is an informal group with a (lack of) structure - topics are discussed in advance but the event itself is fairly open to move in whichever direction the discussion takes it, rather than having a formal rigid itinerary.</p>
    <p>Too many tech meetups are bogged down by uninteresting irrelevant talks given by opinionated 'weblebrities' who are more interested in promoting their own brand than offering something useful to practitioners. We will stick to useful interesting topics that will be of direct benefit, community driven discussions rather than "my opinion is best because I like the sound of my own voice".</p>
