    <h2>Notes for speakers</h2>
    <p>Not sure why you're here, no-one has ever asked us about talking at HMTL before.</p>
    <p>This immediately means you are more organised than 99% of people who have ever talked or attended.</p>
    <p>Don't worry too much about advanced preparation unless you want to or have something already.</p>
    <p>If you can be bothered to put together some slides then please feel free, but don't feel like you have to.</p>
    <p>In general we tend to sit around for a couple of hours before everyone loses patience and we take a swift exit to the nearest pub.</p>
    <p>In that time we try to have 3-4 people talking about whatever they think others might be interested in.</p>
    <p>We would recommend aiming to talk for maybe 10-15 minutes at the most, then we'll have about the same amount of time for questions.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind that there may be anything from 5-25 people there, with a range of technical skills.</p>
    <p>Some are idiots.</p>
    <p>Most are idiots.</p>
    <p>It's not like a real tech meetup. Everyone knows each other fairly well so there will be plenty of mocking and abuse.</p>
    <p>I'm afraid we can't reward you with a cake.</p>
