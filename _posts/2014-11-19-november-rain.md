## Davy - React

Thanks for listening to my ambling and contradicting talk on React. I’ve put the simple React web app I showed you all up on Github:

 - [https://github.com/davymacca/Notes-App-React](https://github.com/davymacca/Notes-App-React)

It requires Bower and Node to run locally. This is by no means best practice, not even close :) the events are bad, the data system is laughable and it’s got globals all over the place. But gets the idea across.

Some other resources that you might find useful

 - [http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) - One of the best places to start is Facebook's own React tutorial
 - [https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) - An awesome list of React resources around the web.
 - [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) - this is the chrome extension that helps with dev work (Reacts rubbish errors messages). If you want to have a go its a must.
