## Matt - Protractor

- [Protractor homepage](http://angular.github.io/protractor/)
- [Intro to protractor by Julie Ralph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvxsWokQblk)
- [Grunt protractor module](https://github.com/teerapap/grunt-protractor-runner) and [Gulp protractor module](https://github.com/mllrsohn/gulp-protractor)
- [Browser statck remote VM testing](http://www.browserstack.com/)
- A good SO post about [how to use it with protractor](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25537919/running-protractor-tests-on-browserstack-automate)


## Paul - Codeship

This post on setting up Codeship to build and deploy a static Middleman blog to S3 covers the basics:

Prose.io can be self-hosted, too:

 - [https://github.com/prose/prose](https://github.com/prose/prose)

And they’re looking for maintainers:

Configure git command aliases:

 - [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks#Git-Aliases](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks#Git-Aliases)

Alias git to g:

 - [http://nuclearsquid.com/writings/git-tricks-tips-workflows/#alias-git-to-g](http://nuclearsquid.com/writings/git-tricks-tips-workflows/#alias-git-to-g)

Then possibly alias hub to g (or git), for the truly lazy:

 - [https://hub.github.com/](https://hub.github.com/)

Node/Grunt tools for checking grammar and spelling:

 - [https://github.com/btford/write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good)
 - [https://github.com/shama/grunt-spell](https://github.com/shama/grunt-spell)

These are more like hinters than linters. Both would be better if they could use custom dictionaries, but work for basics: spotting duplicate words, duplicate words etc. If anyone’s come across anything better, I’d love to hear about it.

Slack referral link with $100 credit both ways:

 - [https://slack.com/r/024zkq68-025l89j0](https://slack.com/r/024zkq68-025l89j0)

The free plan is fine for individuals and small teams, but if I get some credit I can upgrade, invite someone from outside my organisation and stop spamming myself with emoji.
