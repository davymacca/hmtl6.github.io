## Mike - Debugging

As a follow up to the exciting world of step-debugging in Chrome, here are a couple of links.  The Google documentation covers most of it, along with demos:

 - [https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints)
 - [https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-exceptions](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-exceptions)

And this discussion + article has a bunch of tips related to the Chrome / Webkit debugging tools.

## PXG - Learning python

If anyone has questions about the Django project I demoed last night let me know. The source code is on Github:

### Dev setups - PXG

The password generation tool I mentioned last night is `pwgen`.

This can be installed with home brew:

`brew install pwgen`

Then it can be run like so:

`pwgen 14 1`

`man pwgen` to see the whole range of options
