## Davy - Angular

This is the github repo from the Angular Boilerplate/Workflow

 - [https://github.com/davymacca/angularboilerplate](https://github.com/davymacca/angularboilerplate)

The angular boilerplate is more for people who havenâ€™t used angular before. The workflow is just something that makes my life simpler. Lots of improvements could be made as this is just a first draft. Feel free to fork me.
