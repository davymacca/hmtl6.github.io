## PXG - Vagrant

I haven't tried Rove.io put it looks well worth checking out. If you needed additional provisioning and don't want to learn chef you could just run a ssh script the first time you ssh to the box.

SSH key forwarding can be useful if you want to checkout private Github repos or connect to servers from Vagrant machines

## PXG - Deployment

I've put my deployment slides up [here](http://petegraham.co.uk/slides/deployment/) if you have any questions about what I talked about then let me know.

The Favourite Question fabric deploy script is an example of a simple real world fabric deploy script

## Paul - Vagrant

My slides are here:

 - [http://ohskylab.github.io/hmtl-vagrant-talk/](http://ohskylab.github.io/hmtl-vagrant-talk/)

Made a few changes since yesterday, notably adding a resources slide and making everything more orange.

Here's the links to the resources slide to save reading the whole thing (some have already been mentioned upthread: good stuff).

 - [Vagrant docs](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/): start here
 - [Vagrant book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026358.do): just released
 - [Vagrant AWS plugin](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws): manage EC2 and VPC instances with Vagrant
 - [Vagrantbox.es](http://www.vagrantbox.es/): lots of base boxes
 - [Rove](http://rove.io/): Chef and Vagrantfile build tool
 - [Puphet](https://puphpet.com/): Puppet and Vagrantfile for PHP build tool
 - [fabtools](https://github.com/ronnix/fabtools): handy helpers for Fabric, including a Vagrant API

Here's the example I was attempting to use last night:

 - [https://github.com/ohskylab/anglepoised-cv](https://github.com/ohskylab/anglepoised-cv)

Fairly straightforward, if a bit mad. It provisions a VM for a simple [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) site. It's a good (bad) example of a provision script that takes a while to work through. This is mainly down to Pandoc, which is being used to make .docx, .pdf and .md from the HTML. Pandoc is massive.

There's a fabfile in there as well, but look at Pete's Fabric stuff, not mine! His fabfiles are really good, mine are pretty lazy. The fabfile looks for a config.py in the same directory, so either copy config.sample.py to config.py or comment out the "import config" line in fabfile.py (the deployment tasks won't work but local tasks don't use any config).

This probably isn't a very nice way of getting project-specific settings into Fabric; if anyone knows a cleaner way of doing this (env vars?), I'm all ears.
